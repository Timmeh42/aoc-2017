# aoc-2017
Advent of Code 2017 solutions files

I started AoC2017 about 4 days late. Every other solution was done on the day, most within 10 minutes.
Files havent been touched since 2017, so its unknown what condition the solutions were in / whether they all were correct. Some were edited afterwards to try to give a faster or better solution but were abandoned.

I gained both stars on every day; but some days I wrote both parts in the single part1 file.
